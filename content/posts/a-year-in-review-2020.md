I was recently watching a video by this up-and-coming aussie YouTuber on an
exercise he likes to do at the start of every year and thought I'd give it a
shot.

Due to the timing (it's currently May), I'll just be focusing on the current
financial year (July 2020-June 2021).

## Part 1: Assess the past year - What served you and what didn't?

Compile a list of about 30 items which summarise the key things we did in 2020.

- Started investing in the stock market
- Started going out clubbing with Eamon and Matt, and met April
- Started playing Travian again
- Realising that I will one day die and no longer be a part of this world
- Lost motivation to do any coding in my spare time or maintain existing
  projects
- Resigned from Wintech
- Did some token job hunting around Perth (mainly looking at Seek, etc.)
- Decided to become a freelance software engineer
- Obtained my Medium Rigid license and started driving the truck and FOV with
  CSU
- Spent 2 or 3 months "taking time off"
- Started riding my bike
- Went from about 108 kg down to 95 kg over 2 months
- Deteriorating mental health
- Was approached by an Eastern European guy who wanted me to build a CNC
  machine simulator (rejected)
- Was approached by a company in Germany who were using Rust heavily for
  simulating building designs for things like lighting and ecological impact
  (things petered out when they never got back to me)
- Took on a leadership role on my latest Travian server
- Started a contract with Hammer of the Gods
- Started a 6-month contract with Wintech
- Started developing my `arcs` project and was approached by a potential
  user/buyer
- Destroyed my circadian rhythm by attending HotG stand-ups late at night
  then continuing to do work until the sun comes up (only on Tuesdays and
  Thursdays, though)
- Began working from home full time
- Found out Brad was considering leaving Wintech and that Jim might be looking
  to sell the company
- Freaked out 2 weeks into the Wintech contract when I realised I didn't
  actually want to do the work or touch the project
- Was offered a full time position with HotG
- Realised I had developed the belief that I already know everything I will need
  to know about writing software and that everything else isn't worth learning
  anyway (languages or frameworks I'll never use, etc.)
- Went to the Collie horse ride at the start of April and found out Monica was
  dating Matt
- Turned 26 - more existential dread and anxiety around death
- Started missing deadlines for my Wintech work
- Argument with Alex

Then answer the following...

### What excited me?

- Starting out as a freelancer - discussing projects/contracts and learning
  more about how businesses are run
- The different topics covered in the Rune project

### What drained me of energy?

- Wasting days watching YouTube/Netflix/cartoons on the internet
- Work on dead-end projects (no sense of progression, no end in sight, the
  technologies I learn or contacts I make won't contribute towards career, etc.)

### What did I learn?

- Taking time away from work doesn't actually help with motivation or mental
  health unless you have something you can fill it with
- I am not very driven
- I need structure/regime to my day otherwise I just won't do anything
- If I don't want to do something I'm happy to break promises/deadlines,
  knowing the other party will be forced to concede

## Part 2: Your Ideal 2021

What would your ideal 2021 look like in each of these categories:

- Personal Life & Family
- Work, Studies & Profession
- Belongings
- Relaxation, Hobbies & Creativity
- Friends & Community
- Health & Fitness
- Intellectual
- Emotional & Spiritual
- Finances
- Bucket List

Come up with your top 5 goals.

## Part 3: Personal Growth & Identity

Come up with your top 5 goals and ask the following questions for each:

- Why do you want this?
- Who would you have to be in order to hit this goal?
- What would you have to say no to?
- What would you have to say yes to?
- When it gets hard how will you stay the course?
- Why do you deserve this?

## Part 4: Ongoing Habits - Macro & Micro

All these words are great, but they run two big risks:

1. We'll write them down, get really high on inspiration and do nothing
2. We'll write all this down, get really excited and actually act... for about
   two weeks, until we fall back into our old habits.

So, how do we make sure this change is ongoing and how do we make it last?

### Macro

Habit tracking.

- Figure out where all your time is spent
- Make an every-day calendar for a particular goal

### Micro

The idea comes from an old Buddhist quote:

> How you do anything is how you do everything

Some techniques for building up good micro-habits:

- If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately
