## Part 1: Assess the past year - What served you and what didn't?

Compile a list of about 30 items which summarise the key things we did in 2020.

Then answer the following:

### What excited me?

### What drained me of energy?

### What did I learn?

## Part 2: Your Ideal 2021

What would your ideal 2021 look like in each of these categories:

- Personal Life & Family
- Work, Studies & Profession
- Belongings
- Relaxation, Hobbies & Creativity
- Friends & Community
- Health & Fitness
- Intellectual
- Emotional & Spiritual
- Finances
- Bucket List

Come up with your top 5 goals.

## Part 3: Personal Growth & Identity

Come up with your top 5 goals and ask the following questions for each:

- Why do you want this?
- Who would you have to be in order to hit this goal?
- What would you have to say no to?
- What would you have to say yes to?
- When it gets hard how will you stay the course?
- Why do you deserve this?

## Part 4: Ongoing Habits - Macro & Micro

All these words are great, but they run two big risks:

1. We'll write them down, get really high on inspiration and do nothing
2. We'll write all this down, get really excited and actually act... for about
   two weeks, until we fall back into our old habits.

So, how do we make sure this change is ongoing and how do we make it last?

### Macro

Habit tracking.

- Figure out where all your time is spent
- Make an every-day calendar for a particular goal

### Micro

The idea comes from an old Buddhist quote:

> How you do anything is how you do everything

Some techniques for building up good micro-habits:

- If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately
