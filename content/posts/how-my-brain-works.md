I want to do excellent work.

Ask anyone that knows me and they'll tell you I care about quality, precision, long-term results, and clear thinking. But I’ve also learned that how I get to those outcomes doesn’t always look like what’s expected. The better I understand how my brain works, the more I can shape a way of working that’s sustainable, honest, and ultimately more productive - for both myself and the team.

This document outlines the core principles, rhythms, and operating conditions that allow me to do my best work. My goal isn’t special treatment — it’s alignment. When the way I work aligns with the way my brain functions, I produce better outcomes, experience less friction, and recover faster from inevitable periods of lower energy or clarity.

## 1. Autonomy Is Non-Negotiable

The single most important condition for me to do effective, sustained work is autonomy. I recognize that some team workflows require structured collaboration, and I'm fully capable of adapting to those contexts. The key for me is clarity around expectations and the opportunity to bring my own structure to how I contribute. When I know the "why" and "what," I can more easily find a path to align with the "how"—even when the process isn't mine to design. When I’m trusted to solve a problem on my own terms, with clearly defined goals but flexible paths, I thrive. When I feel micromanaged, monitored, or pulled into rigid structures I didn’t design, I struggle to even begin.

What this looks like in practice:
- Assign me a problem, not a method.
- Let me shape the roadmap, architecture, and schedule where appropriate.
- I will proactively check in, document, and align as needed—but the process works best when self-directed.

This isn’t about avoiding collaboration—it’s about owning flow.

## 2. My Productivity Is Cyclical, Not Linear

Some weeks I’m deep in the zone—designing systems, solving hard problems, shipping things that feel invisible but essential. Other weeks, my executive function is low, my cognitive energy is limited, and I need to slow down to stay functional.

I work best in bursts. Long sprints of focused work followed by intentional decompression. This isn’t inconsistency—it’s sustainable pacing.

How I manage this:
- I log work regularly, even if output is minimal.
- I build systems that maintain themselves when my energy dips.
- I return quickly to focus work when the recovery period is respected.

What helps:
- Not overloading my calendar.
- Minimizing context switching during low-output days.
- Letting me choose what to focus on based on energy, not urgency.

## 3. Pressure Kills Momentum

Deadlines, if they’re rigid and externally imposed, can trigger avoidance. It’s not rebellion or laziness - it’s an internal shutdown mechanism. Ironically, I’m often most productive when I don’t feel like something *has* to happen.

What works instead:

- Framing deliverables, not deadlines.
- Mutual agreement on scopes, milestones, or review dates (which I often set myself).
- Lightweight nudges like: "Check in by Friday?" or "Think we could ship this next week?"

I still want to be held accountable, but when the timeline feels collaborative, not coercive, my output improves.

## 4. Clarity and Structure Help — But Only If I Build Them

I like systems. I like writing documentation, defining interfaces, drawing diagrams. But if someone else tries to impose their will or structure *on* me, it often breaks my ability to use it.

The solution:

- Let me build or adapt my own systems for task management, planning, and tracking.
- Avoid assigning me to tools or formats that are overly rigid or prescribed.
- Trust that if I’m quiet, I’m still thinking — I just need to make it make sense to myself first. 

## 5.Recovery Is Part of the Work

I’ve stopped seeing rest as "time away from productivity". If I try to push through burnout, I not only become less effective — I also risk longer recovery and lower quality in everything I do.

What I do instead:

- Pay attention to early warning signs (mental fog, irritability, task paralysis, executive dysfunction)
- Log my energy levels privately so I can plan realistic output windows
- Design my weeks with buffer time between intense deliverables

The result? Fewer surprises, better planning, and longer-term stability.

## 6. I Want to Do Excellent Work — This Is How I Get There

None of this is about making excuses. It’s about being honest and building a system that brings out my best work.

When I’m given the space to work in ways that fit my brain, I:

- Solve complex problems quickly
- See edge cases others miss
- Build systems that endure
- Write clean, adaptable code
- Think several steps ahead of failure modes

When I’m forced into something that doesn’t fit, I:

- Procrastinate, avoid, or freeze
- Burn out quickly
- Lose creative insight
- Resent tasks I’d otherwise enjoy

I’m still learning how to articulate all this. But what I know is this: *I care deeply about what I build. I want to work on meaningful problems with smart, kind people. And I want to do that in a way that doesn’t cost me my health or motivation.*

The more aligned my working conditions are with how I naturally operate, the more value I can bring and the longer I’ll be able to keep doing it.

Thanks for reading.
