A while back I got myself into a bit of a pickle.

I was 25 at the time and had quit my previous job as a Software Engineer at
Wintech to look for new opportunities. I'm not quite sure what my plans were,
or even if I had any proper plans at that point, but I got it into my head
that I would take a month or two off then look for a job which would recognise
me for what I'm *really worth*.

Fast-forward about 3 months and I've achieved nothing of note. Zip, Zilch,
Nada. Then all of a sudden people start contacting me for collaborations or
potential jobs.

There were a couple really interesting opportunities, but at the time I felt
the one most likely to eventuate and keep me gainfully employed was a job
from Wintech to convert Profiler 9 to "Profiler 8.2". This is where we would
re-skin the existing Profiler 9 to look as close as possible to Profiler 8.

I jumped on the opportunity and very quickly created a rough outline of the
work that needed doing and put together an ambitious timeline.

## The Problem

I started off really strong with a lot of momentum. The first task (redoing
toolbars) was completed exactly when I said it would be, but then I ran into
menus and the wheels just fell off.

The entire task was *massive* and I'd only budgeted 1-2 days for it. Add to
that the fact that a lot of the work was tedious (create new command, wire it
up to a menu item, find the code that should be called, tweak when it is
enabled/disabled, test, rinse and repeat x40 - soooo much busy work) and I
almost immediately fell into despair.

To fulfil the *"identical to Profiler 8"* requirement I felt like I had to do
things in a way that I don't agree with and that were actively decreasing the
quality of my work. Of course my previous implementation was subtly
incompatible with the way Profiler 8 wanted things to be done, so all of that
work needed to be thrown away and done again.

You can see how this might be a bit disheartening.

When I was originally negotiating this project I didn't properly think about
how I'd feel while doing it. I quit Wintech Engineering because I felt like I
was no longer being challenged and the entire industry's culture of risk
aversion and *"if it ain't broke, don't fix it"* was frustrating me. I *knew*
this deep down, but kinda disregarded it and figured I'd be able to soldier
on through.

Don't be too eager to sign the contract. Before committing to anything, ask
yourself:

- Is this project in my best interest?
- What do you want to get out of it?
- Am I passionate about the topic?
- How will I *feel* while doing this?
- Can you soldier on through the undesirable parts? Do you want to?

If any of those questions raises a red flag, **address it**.

In the meantime, I'd already started negotiating (and committed to) a
freelancing gig with a startup in San Francisco. This job ticked all my boxes,

- I would be working as part of a team
- It would be a fast-paced environment
- The project would have lots of interesting technical challenges
- It used technologies I wanted to use, and most importantly
- Taking on the project would take my career in a direction I wanted it to go

The contrast between the two was like night and day.
