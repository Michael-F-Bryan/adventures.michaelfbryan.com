In a project I've been playing around with recently, we've encountered the
dilemma where you want to make it easy for users to write their own
application logic using the system, but at the same want to keep that logic
decoupled from the implementation details of whatever platform the
application is running on.

If you've been programming for any amount of time your immediate reaction is
probably *"why bother mentioning this, doesn't it just fall out of good
library design?"*, and normally I would totally agree with you, except I
forgot to mention a couple important details...

1. People need to be able to upload new code while the system is still running
2. This application will be interacting with the real world, and we *really*
   don't want a crash in user-provided code to make the entire system
   stop responding

The normal solution for the first point is to use some sort of [plugin
architecture][plugins], however using something like *Dynamic Loading*
doesn't solve the second point and the large amounts of `unsafe` code needed
can arguably make the situation worse. For that we'll need some sort of
sandboxing mechanism.

Introducing...

Web Assembly has gained a lot of traction over the last couple years as a way
to write code in any language and run it in the browser, but it can be used for
so much more.

There are already [several][wasmer] [general-purpose][lucet]
[runtimes][wasmtime] available for running WASM in a Rust program. These
runtimes give you a virtual machine which can run arbitrary code, and the
only way this code can interact with the outside world is via the functions you
explicitly give it access to.
