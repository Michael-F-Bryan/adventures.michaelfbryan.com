Iterators are part of Rust's secret sauce. They power things from the humble
for-loop to the elegant iterator chain, but have you ever stopped to think how
they work?

Let's find out more about Rust's iterators by implementing our own versions of
common iterators and reading the standard library's source code.

## The Iterator Trait

At its most simplest, an iterator is just something with a `next()` method that
may return some `Item` or `None`.

This is all encapsulated in the [`std::iter::Iterator`][std-iter] trait, with
the definition looking something like this:

```rust
trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

Now you may be wondering why most Rust code doesn't have calls to `next()`
scattered throughout, and that's where [*Syntactic Sugar*][syntactic-sugar]
comes in. This is where the compiler will see certain high level constructs in
your code and transform them into a lower level form.

 The humble for-loop is probably the most familiar instance of this syntactic
 sugar.

For example, when the compiler sees this...

```rust
for item in 0..5 {
    println!("{}", item);
}
```

... the code will be transformed into this...

```rust
let mut iterator = (0..5).into_iter();

while let Some(item) = iterator.next() {
    println!("{}", item);
}
```

[(playground)](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=9c2994be6caac61c54698b2e5adf9f94)

What this does is turn the range expression, `0..5`, into an iterator and then
keep calling its `next()` method until we get `None`.

{{% notice note %}}

This `into_iter()` method (backed by the [`std::iter::IntoIterator`][into-iter]
trait) is a way to transform something into an iterator.

Some common types that implement `IntoIterator` are [`Vec<T>`][vec-into-iter],
[`Option<T>`][option-into-iter], and most importantly, [anything implementing
the `Iterator` trait][iter-into-iter] (which will just return itself).

This trait comes in handy because it often means you can use a collection in a
for-loop without needing to call some `iter()` method, because most collections
have an `IntoIterator` implementation which will pull items out of the
collection until there is nothing left (at which point the collection is
destroyed).

## Fibonacci

Now we have some basic familiarity with iterators, let's create our own iterator
over all the Fibonacci numbers that fit into a `u32`.

First we'll create a new `Fibonacci` type.

```rust
struct Fibonacci {
    a: u32,
    b: u32,
}
```

Then we implement the `Iterator` trait. The idea is that each call to `next()`
will do just enough work to generate the next number in the sequence.

```rust
impl Iterator for Fibonacci {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<u32> {
        // Try to add "a" and "b", returning None if the addition would
        // overflow to signal that we've reached the end of the sequence.
        let next_term = self.a.checked_add(self.b)?;

        self.a = self.b;
        self.b = next_term;

        Some(next_term)
    }
}
```

{{% notice note %}}
You'll notice we use the [`checked_add()`][checked-add] method here instead of
the normal `+` operator. This is important because we are working with
fixed-size integers and we need a stopping condition.

Without it, we would reach `2_971_215_073` and either panic (in debug mode)
overflow (in release mode). This is Rust's way of telling us that we if we are
creating bigger and bigger numbers we should handle the situation when our
numbers get too big for the integer type we are using.

We actually miss the top two Fibonacci numbers using the above `Iterator`
implementation, but adding extra logic to handle them would complicate the
example and you wouldn't actually learn anything new about iterators.

[checked-add]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html#method.checked_add
{{% /notice %}}

Now all we need is a helper function to create a `Fibonacci` object with our
initial conditions  and a `main()` function that uses it in a loop and we're
good to go.

```rust
fn fibonacci_numbers() -> Fibonacci {
    Fibonacci { a: 1, b: 0 }
}

fn main() {
    for number in fibonacci_numbers() {
        println!("{}", number);
    }
}
```

[(playground)](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=5ecf8f52253983fabe7b24edc2ed6c8d)

Strictly speaking the helper function wasn't really necessary, but it helps make
the code cleaner and means readers won't see `Fibonacci { a: 1, b: 0 }` and
wonder where we pulled those magic numbers from.

Alternatively, we could have implemented the `Default` trait.

## Iterating Over a Slice

Iterators are commonly used to inspect the items in a collection. The simplest
collection type is a slice, so let's create our own version of
[`std::slice::Iter`][slice-iter].

First we need a struct which keeps track of the slice and the index of the next
item to read.

```rust
struct SliceIter<'a, T> {
    slice: &'a [T],
    index: usize,
}
```

Our implementation then just uses [the slice's `get()` method][slice-get] to get
the item at that index or `None` if the index is past the end of the slice.  We
then just use `?` to return `None` if there was no item, then increment our
`index` before yielding the item to the caller.

```rust
impl<'a, T> Iterator for SliceIter<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let item = self.slice.get(self.index)?;
        self.index += 1;

        Some(item)
    }
}
```

{{% notice info %}}
For the curious, I've also implemented [an `unsafe` version][unsafe]. I'll leave
comparing the two for performance as an exercise for the reader, but gut feel
says they'll be identical.

I'd love you to prove me wrong and explain why on Reddit or the user forums,
though ðŸ˜‰

Just for fun, here is a cute version based on [*Slice Patterns*][slice-patterns].

```rust
struct SliceIter<'a, T> {
    slice: &'a [T],
}

impl<'a, T> Iterator for SliceIter<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        match self.slice {
            [first, rest @ ..] => {
                self.slice = rest;
                Some(first)
            }
            [] => None,
        }
    }
}
```

[(playground)](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=0fcc643b63d1d1718170ee2b4389fbfd)

## Filter

One of the most commonly used iterator combinators is [`filter()`][filter], a
combinator which takes an iterator and a predicate and only yields items where
that predicate returns `true`.

You often see it used like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let even_numbers = (0..10).filter(|n| n % 2 == 0);

    for number in even_numbers {
        println!("{}", number);
    }
}
```

[(playground)](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=add1a5b92871b9162b4de061976393b3)

We get the following output, as expected:

```
0
2
4
6
8
```

Now, let's write our own implementation!

First we'll need a `Filter` type and some way of constructing it. For ergonomics,
you would normally create an extension trait with a `fn filter()` method that
returns `Filter` and implement that for all iterators, but we'll be lazy and
just write a function.

```rust
struct Filter<I, F> {
    iter: I,
    predicate: F,
}

fn filter<I, F>(iter: I, predicate: F) -> impl Iterator<Item = I::Item>
{
    Filter { iter, predicate }
}
```

{{% notice tip %}}
In this situation we've chosen to use `impl Trait` for the return value instead
of providing an explicit type.

The `Filter` struct is just an implementation detail, and not necessarily one we
want people to code against or make public, so we make the concrete type
unnameable.
{{% /notice %}}

Now we obviously need to implement the `Iterator` trait on `Filter`.

The naive implementation would look something like this:

```rust
impl<I, F> Iterator for Filter<I, F>
where
    I: Iterator,
    F: FnMut(&I::Item) -> bool,
{
    type Item = I::Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let item = self.iter.next()?;

        if (self.predicate)(&item) {
            Some(item)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

fn filter<I, F>(iter: I, predicate: F) -> impl Iterator<Item = I::Item>
where
    I: IntoIterator,
    F: FnMut(&I::Item) -> bool,
{
    Filter {
        iter: iter.into_iter(),
        predicate,
    }
}
```

[(playground)](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=518ed8c15e89a1807ac1c8881211e7a1)

{{% notice tip %}}
You might have noticed we chose to accept a `FnMut` closure for our predicate
instead of a plain `Fn`. This lets our closure carry mutable state across calls
and enables complex patterns like this:

```rust
let text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit";

let mut letter_m_threshold = 3;

let everything_before_the_3rd_word_containing_m = filter(
    text.split_whitespace(),
    |word| {
        if word.contains("m") {
            letter_m_threshold  -= 1;
        }
        letter_m_threshold > 0
    },
);

let got: Vec<&str> = everything_before_the_3rd_word_containing_m .collect();
assert_eq!(got, &["Lorem", "ipsum", "dolor", "sit"]);
```

Similarly, we choose to pass in an `&I::Item` because we want to give the
predicate access to the item, but it shouldn't be given ownership (because then
our iterator has nothing to yield) or allowed to mutate the item.
{{% /notice %}}

You can see we pull the next item out of the inner iterator (using `?` to return
`None` if there are no more items), then we call the predicate function provided
by the user to check whether we should yield the item.

However, there is a small issue... Check out the output:

```
0
```

We're stopping after the first `false` item!

What we actually need to do is write a loop which keeps pulling items out of
the iterator until the predicate is satisfied.


```rust
impl<I, F> Iterator for Filter<I, F>
where
    I: Iterator,
    F: FnMut(&I::Item) -> bool,
{
    type Item = I::Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        while let Some(item) = self.iter.next() {
            if (self.predicate)(&item) {
                return Some(item);
            }
        }

        None
    }
}
```

## Conclusions

We've barely scratched the surface on what iterators can achieve, but hopefully
you'll now have an understanding of how iterator combinators like `filter()` and
`map()` are implemented.

Iterators may touch on some higher-level topics like closures, associated types,
and syntactic sugar, but they aren't magic. Plus, when in doubt you can always
just [read the source][std].
