### 1. Introduction

- **Problem Statement:** Outline the problem of keeping generated Rust code up to date.
- **Solution Overview:** Briefly introduce the technique of using tests to automatically re-generate code.
- **Importance:** Explain why this method is valuable to the Rust community, and perhaps mention its adaptation from Rust Analyzer.

Last year I came across this cool technique for 

Ever found yourself neck-deep in code, orchestrating data generation, and then
realizing that things are drifting out of sync? Trust me, I've been there, and
I'm sure you have too. Staring at an auto-generated GraphQL schema that somehow
got divorced from reality can feel like watching a train derail in slow motion.

But fear not, my fellow Rustaceans and code wranglers! There's a beautiful
solution to this quagmire, lurking in the very place where we seek solace from
our coding mishaps â€“ the world of testing. In fact, we're about to embark on a
coding adventure that will not only align our stars but keep them that way. ðŸš€

We'll dive headfirst into a technique that leverages the power of tests to
automatically generate data (whether it be code, a GraphQL schema, or that
secret sauce you use in your projects) and keep it all neatly aligned. You might
even say it's like having a personal robot assistant that tirelessly ensures
everything is in its right place. (I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords!)

So grab your favorite beverage, cozy up to your keyboard, and let's get started.
By the end of this post, you'll have the tools to keep your generated data in
perfect harmony. We'll explore real-world scenarios, get our hands dirty with
some code, and maybe even share a laugh or two along the way.

Ready to simplify your life, one test at a time? Let's dive in!
