A couple days ago I released [markedit][crates-io], a small crate for
manipulating unstructured markdown documents. This is a useful enough library
that I thought I'd explain the main ideas behind it and potential use cases.

This originally came about when I was at work, preparing our application's
change log before a release for the umpteenth time (we've found the [keep a
changelog][kac] format really useful) and on the drive home I started thinking
of ways to automate things.

To put this into context, we've tried to automate the release process as much
as possible to minimise friction and avoid using the time required to cut a
release as an excuse for putting it off. It's now at the point where the
fairly involved process of generating a release (compiling independent
projects written in multiple languages, rendering docs, bumping version
numbers, tagging commits, generating installers, uploading assets to a file
server, etc.) can be done with a single click.

Everything's automated. The whole system functions like a well-oiled machine...
Except for that annoying change log.

See, I still need to manually promote everything under the `[Unreleased]`
section to its own named release (e.g. `[v1.2.3] - 2020-02-09`) and update
links so `[Unreleased]` now points to the diff between the `v1.2.3` tag and
`master`, and `[v1.2.3]` shows the diff between `v1.2.2` and `v1.2.3`. The
linked pages look kinda [like this][gitlab-compare] and are surprisingly useful
when trying to track down regressions or get an overview of what code changed
between releases.

It's only a couple find-and-replace operations, but needing to spend an extra
60 seconds manually editing files before a release acts as a speed bump.

## The Main Concepts

Now that I've explained the initial inspiration for this project, let's have
a high-level look at the implementation.

There are a couple fundamental concepts, but the central one is the stream of
[markdown `Event`s][event] emitted by [pulldown-cmark][pc]'s markdown parser.
This is just an iterator over things like `Event::Start(Tag::Heading(1))`,
`Event::Text("some text")`, and `Event::End(Tag::Link(...))`.

Reusing the `Iterator` interface from the standard library already makes
`pulldown-cmark` quite easy to use but when you're trying to look for a
specific pattern (e.g. *"the first line after a level 1 heading"*) the code
starts to get pretty gnarly.

For example, [the logic in `mdbook`][parse-summary] for parsing a
`SUMMARY.md` and discovering the book's structure is particularly hard to
understand, and the fact it's barely been touched in two years is a good
indicator of that. I feel a bit guilty for writing such a code monster ðŸ˜”

To ease this problem of matching sequences of events we introduce the concept
of a *Matcher*, something which can be fed `Event`s and will tell you when it
finds a match. It's essentially a fancy predicate.

To actually do something once you've found a match we have rewriting rules. This
is a bit of code which lets you manipulate the stream of events in-place (e.g.
by skipping certain items or adding new ones).

Something to note is this entire process is built upon the `Iterator` trait. At
no point should the `markedit` crate assume you've parsed an entire document
into memory beforehand.

My primary reasons for this were:

- Memory usage - a document contains *a lot* of `Event`s, and by not reading
  everything into memory we can avoid large amounts of memory (memory overhead
  with iterators is `O(1)` instead of `O(n)`)
- Performance - there's no need for unnecessary copies and buffering
- Flexibility - the core algorithms don't care if the events are already in a
  buffer, streamed from the network, or the caller has already done some
  pre-processing of the events via the various iterator combinators
- Because I can - I just curious to see how far I can push the language and my
  own skills
