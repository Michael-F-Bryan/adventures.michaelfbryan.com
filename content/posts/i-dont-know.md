I'm going to propose something which is hopefully nothing to you...

> In the tech world, it's not about *what* you know, it's your ability to learn
> new concepts and find information that really matters.

As part of my work I am responsible for a very wide range of technologies
which have very different sets of domain specific knowledge. For example, I'm
the lead software engineer for our company's CAD/CAM package, the Computer
Aided Design part requires a strong understanding of computational geometry
and creating a Windows Graphical User Interface. I also help maintain the
embedded C codebase which is used to control the CNC machines we build, and
am helping design the next generation of controller.

All of this means people from other areas (electrical engineering, sales,
etc.) will look to me as the domain expert when dealing with anything related
to software.

For a lot of these issues there's a good chance I won't know the answer, it
may require knowing about systems or APIs that I've never dealt with before,
and a lot of the time the only honest answer I can give them is a simple
*"I don't know"*.

And you know what, that's okay.

It's okay to admit you don't know everything, it's a part of being human.

I think a lot of people forget that, and instead choose to make excuses or
pretend they know the answer to save face.

## "I don't know... but if you give me 10 minutes I can find out"

Several years ago I read an article where the author said it's okay to admit
you don't know the answer... Just as long as you follow it up with something
like "but give me 5 minutes and I can find out for you".

As an example, say the electrical engineer finds out that the stepper motor
we're currently using for positioning becomes obsolete and they need to
source a new model. They may ask for my thoughts on different alternatives
because the motor is driven by the CNC machine's controller and we want to
make sure it's compatible.

Now, I'm no expert on stepper motor control and have no idea how any of the
candidate motors work, so the honest answer is to say *"I don't know"*.

The electrical engineer in this example isn't expecting me to know everything
that is possibly related to the controller, but at the same time they're still
relying on me to provide information they need to make a decision.

This is where the ability to learn and quickly find relevant knowledge comes
in.

    - Talk about why being able to find the right information is important
    - Curry favour by indicating you want to invest your own time to help the
      person ("play the game")

## Be Honest

<!--
    - Be honest up front to help manage expectations and not give the wrong
      idea.
    - Show quality of character by being okay with not knowing the answer to
      everything ("Play the game")
    - People will gain confidence in your ability to give honest, accurate
      feedback/opinions, even if it may be hard to hear

 ## Lifelong Learning

 <!--
    - Show that you are always wanting to improve your knowledge
    - Actually try to learn and improve your knowledge
-->

## Oh Yes, I Remember Now

One person that worked under me would ask for help when they didn't know
something (which is fine). However when pointed in the right direction or
give an answer, would say something like *"oh yes I remember now, silly me"*
and pretend they knew the answer all along (which is definitely *not* fine).

This was a pet peeve of mine.

I'm happy to help you if you don't know how to do something or are struggling
with a tricky concept, but if you then turn around and pretend you knew all
along I'm going to assume that,

1. You are telling the truth and your memory really does leak like a sieve. In
   which case I'll question your competence and ability to carry out more
   advanced tasks which require understanding the bigger picture and how
   other components interact with what you are working on
2. You decided it would be easier to waste 10 minutes of my time and break my
   flow instead of googling the problem. Then to save face you turned around and
   indicate you didn't need my help in the first place

The first couple times I'll give someone the benefit of the doubt, but if you
are asking the same questions time after time and haven't put any effort in
(reading the error message, plugging keywords into Google, etc.) I'm going to
get a little frustrated.

That's not how you want to play the game.
