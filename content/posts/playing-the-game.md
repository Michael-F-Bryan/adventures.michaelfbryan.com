It's something that they never teach you in school or university,

## Give Me Solutions, Not Problems

<!-- Management want to hear solutions, not problems/complaints ("we've identified
X as hindering progress and we can fix it by doing Y, and Z" versus just "X
is slowing us down"). If you propose a solution up front it's easy to get
approval and you appear to "take the initiative" -->

## Persuade Me

## Everyone Has an Agenda

<!-- Everyone has an agenda. Try to understand the other person's and see how you
can use it for mutual benefit, You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours -->

## The Gentle Application of Pressure

<!-- The gentle application of pressure... Provides a small amount of stress and
feeling of progress... Need to know when to take the foot off though -->

## Perceived Productivity

<!-- Perceived productivity (i.e. lots of solved issues or new features) is more
important than actual productivity (i.e. refactoring an existing codebase to
be cleaner and more maintainable) -->

## Go Ugly Early

<!-- Don't avoid conflict or bad news, "go ugly early". Be honest and use the
opportunity to show you want to help the other party -->

## It's Okay to say *"I don't know"*

In the tech industry, more-so than potentially any other industry in the modern
world, your ability to learn and find answers is more important than what you
already know.

To make this more concrete, imagine talking to a co-worker or your boss and
they say something like *"what are your thoughts adding a line simplification
tool based on [the Ramer‚ÄìDouglas‚ÄìPeucker algorithm][rdp] to our CAD
package?"* (sneaky plug for my [Line Simplification
article][line-simplification]).

Now you may not immediately know whether this is practical, or even what
Ramer‚ÄìDouglas‚ÄìPeucker is, so the honest answer would be so shrug and say
*"I don't know"* ü§∑‚Äç

But a lot of people are ashamed when they don't immediately know the answer
to something. They'll often creating excuses or even making things up to
avoid admitting they don't know everything.

I feel like this mentality kinda misses the point. A lot of the time I'm not
asking you a question and expecting an immediate answer

{{% notice info %}}
One person that worked under me would ask for help when they didn't know
something (which is fine). However when pointed in the right direction or
give an answer, would say something like *"oh yes I remember now, silly me"*
and pretend they knew the answer all along (which is definitely *not* fine).

This was a pet peeve of mine.

I'm happy to help you if you don't know how to do something or are struggling
with a tricky concept, but if you then turn around and pretend you knew all
along I'm going to assume that,

1. You are telling the truth and your memory really does leak like a sieve. In
   which case I'll question your competence and ability to carry out more
   advanced tasks which require understanding the bigger picture and how
   other components interact with what you are working on
2. You lied to save face and can't admit that you don't know everything
3. You decided it would be easier to waste 10 minutes of my time and break my
   flow instead of googling the problem. Then to save face you turned around and
   indicate you didn't need my help in the first place

The first couple times I'll give someone the benefit of the doubt, but if you
are asking the same questions time after time and haven't put any effort in
(reading the error message, plugging keywords into Google, etc.) I'm going to
get a little frustrated.

That's not how you want to play the game.
