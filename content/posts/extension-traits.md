A nice consequence of the way Rust's type system works is a pattern called
the *Extension Trait*.

Most of the examples developed in this article are also linked to on the
*Rust Playground*. Feel free to browse through and steal code or inspiration.

## Motivation

- Add helper methods to an existing type
    - Like monkey-patching, but only the code that explicitly imports a
      extension will be affected
- Create an interface for additional functionality which is only sometimes
  available

## The General Mechanism

- Create a trait then implement it for each of the types
- Often uses macros for repetitive impls
- Touch on the orphan rule

## Unwrap or Trap

## Other Examples in the Wild

- the `itertools` crate
- `std::os::windows::ffi::OsStrExt`

## Conclusion
