# Reboot-Friendly Projects: Building Systems That Let You Disappear (and Come Back)

You get an idea. You get excited. You start building.

Then one day â€” you stop.

No dramatic reason. No catastrophic failure. Just... gone. You forget about it. Or you can't bear to look at it. Or you move on. And when you do want to come back, you can't remember what anything meant or why you even cared.

This isn't a lack of discipline. It's just a natural part of working on long-term or creative projects.

The fix? Stop trying to force consistency. Start designing for disappearance.

Enter: Reboot-Friendly Projects.

## What Is a Reboot-Friendly Project?

A Reboot-Friendly Project is something you can walk away from â€” for a week, a month, even a year â€” and return to without confusion, friction, or wasted effort. It's structured to:

- Be resilient to long gaps in activity
- Offer low-friction re-entry points
- Preserve context and momentum even when you're offline
- Make long-tail creativity less stressful

It's a kindness to *Future You* â€” the version of you who still believes in the thing, even if they got pulled away for a while.

## Why Reboot-Friendly Design Matters

- Unexpected pauses will happen: travel, illness, job changes, creative slumps.
- Life isn't linear. Neither are most personal or exploratory projects.
- Trying to maintain constant progress leads to frustration or project abandonment.

Instead, assume the dropout is part of the process â€” and design for it from the beginning.

## Key Principles of Reboot-Friendly Projects

### 1. Leave Breadcrumbs for *Future You*

- Write short notes like:
  - "Last thing I did was X. Next step might be Y."
  - "Still excited about Z. Didn't finish. That's fine."
- Date your notes. Be casual. Keep them in a visible place.

### 2. Use Atomic Commits (and Commit Messages That Talk Like a Human)

- Don't just write `fix bug`
- Try: `Fixed that annoying off-by-one in chart.jsâ€”maybe revisit this later?`
- A *Future You* trying to decode your git history will thank you.

### 3. Structure Projects Modually

- Make it easy to work on one part at a time.
- Each sub-component should have:
  - Clear inputs/outputs
  - A `README` or top-of-file comment
  - A clear "done-enough" state

### 4. Accept That Pauses Aren't Failures

- Don't delete a project just because you haven't touched it in months.
- Don't assume it has to be consistent to be real.
- Every long-term or creative project has quiet periods.

### 5. Create a "Reboot Ritual"

- A 3-step way to re-enter any project:
  1. Read your last log or note
  2. List 3 things you still like about the idea
  3. Do a 10-minute task (low stakes, zero pressure)

Make this a template and use it guilt-free.

## Reboot-Friendly Tooling Tips

- Use a README that always starts with "What this is."
  - e.g., "This is a CLI for scraping server data and pushing to Postgres. Built because X was annoying me."
    - Bonus: put a TL;DR section at the top.
    - Avoid documenting for othersâ€”just orient *Future You*.
- Capture recent logs as part of shutdown. Even 30 seconds of context here can save you 2 hours later.
- Leave `TODO` and `FIXME` comments that you can easily `grep` for
- Color-code or tag project status (ðŸŸ¢ active, ðŸŸ¡ paused, ðŸ”´ unknown)

## Final Thought

Reboot-Friendly Projects let you step in and out of your work without friction or shame.

You're not failing because you paused. You're just operating like someone with a lot going on.

Consistency is a myth. Resumability is a skill.

Design accordingly.

If this idea resonates with you, I'd suggest reading [*Coping strategies for the serial project hoarder*](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/) by Simon Willison. There's a lot of overlap between reboot-friendly projects and his technique for managing a *massive* number of projects, and that article helped inspire this one.
