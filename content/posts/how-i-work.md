## Core Values

- **Technical Excellence**
    - I strive to do things right the first time and avoid short-term hacks that create long-term pain.
    - Code should be understandable, maintainable, and robust.
    - Use the type system - create code and interfaces where users fall into the pit of success
- **Pragmatism**
    - I value solutions that balance ideal outcomes with real-world constraints.
    - I’ll favour efficient, practical approaches over unnecessary complexity or perfectionism.
- **Transparency & Accountability**
    - I believe in clear documentation, open communication, and making decisions visible.
    - I welcome feedback and am happy to justify technical choices.
- **Continuous Learning & Improvement**
    - I enjoy learning new skills and refining my processes.
    - I reflect on mistakes and am always looking to improve how I work.
- **Autonomy**
    - I work best when I have ownership and flexibility in how I approach problems.
    - I’m most productive when trusted to get things done my way, rather than being micromanaged.
- **Motivation-Driven Productivity**
    - My productivity is closely tied to interest and motivation, so I naturally work in peaks and troughs.
    - I deliver best on projects that align with my skills, interests, and sense of purpose.

## Working With Me - What To Expect

- I will ask "why" before "how", and question decisions that don’t make sense to me.
- You can expect direct, honest feedback - both giving and receiving.
- I’ll proactively flag technical debt, shortcuts, or decisions that might cause problems down the track.
- I appreciate clear goals, the space to solve problems, and support when needed - without unnecessary oversight.
- I’m happy to document, share knowledge, and help set up processes that make things easier for everyone.
- If I disagree with a direction, I’ll call it out constructively.

## Professional Anti-Values

- **Cargo-Culting & Thoughtless Process**
    - Blindly following process or "best practices" without considering context or actual value
    - Applying tools or methodologies just because "that’s how it’s always done"
- **Superficial Solutions**
    - Quick hacks that leads to future technical debt
    - Sacrificing long-term stability for minor short-term wins
- **Micromanagement**
    - Excessive oversight, rigid deadlines, or lack of trust in my ability to deliver
    - Being forced into approaches or decisions without good justification or the ability to direct the solution
- **Lack of Transparency**
    - Hidden agendas, poor documentation, or unclear communication
    - Decisions made behind closed doors without involving relevant stakeholders
- **Bureaucracy for Its Own Sake**
    - Overly complex or burdensome process that doesn’t deliver real value
    - Meetings, paperwork, or rituals that don’t move the work forward
- **Stagnation & Complacency**
    - Settling for "good enough" when there’s clear room for improvement
    - Resistance to change, learning, or honest feedback
- **Punishing Peaks & Troughs**
    - Expecting perfectly steady output regardless of context, motivation, or reality
    - Treating natural productivity cycles as a personal failing rather than a fact of creative/technical work

Don't think of these as hard and fast rules. Instead, think of them more like factors that may contribute to low motivation or reduced performance.

### Deep Dives & "Side-Quests"

- I have a tendency to follow "side-quests" or deep dives - exploring adjacent problems, refactoring, or solving issues that aren’t always on the immediate critical path.
- From the outside, this might sometimes look unnecessary or off-task, but:
    - It often leads to better long-term solutions, improved understanding, or prevents bigger problems later.
    - Many of my best contributions come from connecting dots, cleaning up tech debt, or generalising solutions during these explorations.
- I try to balance this with the needs of the team and project priorities, but a degree of "productive wandering" is core to how I work and grow.
- If there’s concern that I’m getting too far off the main track, I appreciate a quick, candid check-in - happy to justify or course-correct if needed.
