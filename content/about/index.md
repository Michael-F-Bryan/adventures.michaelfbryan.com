title: "About Me"
---

You're probably coming here after seeing me on [GitHub][gh] or [GitLab][gl]. I'm
also pretty active on the [Rust User Forums][urlo].

In my spare time I like to learn more about computer science, in particular
embedded systems, high performance applications (e.g. games), and compilers.

My top 4 favourite programming languages:

1. [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
2. [Go](https://golang.org)
3. [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
4. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Some projects I've been involved in:

- [mdbook][mdbook] - a program for compiling a set of *Markdown* files into a 
  website which can be viewed online. I was the maintainer from November 2017 to 
  January 2019
- [The RustFFI Guide][ffi-guide] - A tutorial which teaches people how to
  interoperate between Rustand other languages via C APIs
- [gcode-rs][gcode] - A crate for parsing g-code programs without allocations,
  primarily designed for embedded devices
- [libsignal-protocol-rs][libsignal] - An idiomatic Rust wrapper around the
  `libsignal-protocol-c` library, the canonical implementation of the 
  [*Signal Protocol*][libsignal-c] (the crypto library underneath WhatsApp and
  Signal)

Before discovering I was good at programming and getting a job due to my
experience and merit, I studied 3 years of a 4 year Mechanical Engineering
degree. 

I still enjoy learning about how the world works and leveraging my
engineering knowledge wherever I can, whether that is in the geometry
required to write a CAD program at work, or using the equations of motion and
PID control to simulate a motion controller.

## Resume

If you want a more formal view, check out [my resume][resume-pdf]. The entire
repository is [publicly available][resume-repo], and uses GitLab's CI system
to automatically re-compile the PDF whenever new changes are pushed to
`master`.
