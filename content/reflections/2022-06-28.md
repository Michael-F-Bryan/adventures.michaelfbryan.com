- Writing up that *Announcing Cargo WAPM* blog post
- Mopping the kitchen and having washed dishes
- Cooking that spinach cottage pie

## What Drained Me of Energy?

- Feeling fatigued at random times for no reason
- Realising that HOTG might be coming to an end so a lot of the tasks I had
  started last week are no longer relevant
- Hearing that Akshay was pitching *"Weld Enterprise"* to Anthem when it's
  not really related to anything we've been developing so far
- Mum asking me if I'll ever look for a romantic partner

## What Did I Learn?

- I can still write blog posts if I want to

## What Are 10 Things I'm Grateful For?

1. Hello Fresh gives me good, healthy food
2. My friendship with my coworkers
3. The easy-to-use publishing pipeline I've set up for my website
4. Having a nice 4-colour pen and good writing pad for taking notes
5. I don't need to pay full price for rent
6. I can get away with only doing a couple of hours of proper work
7. I am in a pretty secure financial position
8. Being alive

10. I can pay my license & rego online instead of needing to talk to a person

## How Did I Push the Needle Forward?

- Writing up that *Announcing Cargo WAPM* blog post and making sure people would
  associate my name with it
