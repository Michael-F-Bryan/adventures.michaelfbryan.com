## What Excited Me?

- Starting these daily reflections
- Hearing stories from Vanessa's trip up north
- Potentially seeing the collapse of a company, and the life experiences I might
  gain along the way

## What Drained Me of Energy?

- Only getting 3 or 4 hours sleep the night before
- Procrastinating the afternoon away instead of doing work or having an
  afternoon siesta to catch up on sleep

## What Did I Learn?

- How custom sections work in Hugo
- How to hide articles in Hugo
- HOTG have less than a month's runway left and if they don't land something in
  the next week they'll almost certainly go under

## What Are 10 Things I'm Grateful For?

1. That I can go on last-minute camping trips and not have to worry about work
   in the morning
2. The Darklands Druid series of books
3. How warm my thermals and sleeping bag are
4. Nobody broke into or towed my car overnight
5. Caim's comprehensive starting guide
6. That Akshay and Kartik were open about the HOTG probably going bust
7. The relationship I have with my coworkers
8. I have enough savings to be able to see the end of HOTG
9. I have a set of really advanced skills that should be easy to market
10. I keep lip balm in my personal admin kit

## How Did I Push the Needle Forward?

- I started these daily reflections
- I decided to stay with HOTG until they fold so I can learn more about business
  and leverage their networks to find my next job
