## What Excited Me?

- Getting my copy of *Rust for Rustaceans* in the mail
- Reading the last book in the *Darkland Druids* series

## What Drained Me of Energy?

- Realising that HOTG has put all their hopes on a deal which has a low chance
  of landing before the company runs out of money, and even if we do land it,
  the content is far enough from what we're doing at the moment that we'll
  probably be starting from scratch
- ... And there is no plan B
- Spending 4 hours wiring up CI/CD for Weld Studio
- Feeling randomly fatigued
- Realising that HOTG going under will hurt my chances of buying a house

## What Did I Learn?

- I don't have an Apple Developer account under HOTG

## What Are 10 Things I'm Grateful For?

1. The chicken with garlic sauce and mash potato I had for dinner
2. Stable financial situation
3. Buying *Rust for Rustaceans* all that time ago
4. Finding Nicole Taylor's books (*Darkland Druids*, etc.)
5. That I took over Vanessa's old MacBook Pro
6. You can find loads of entertaining books online
7. My thermals
8. I took notes from Monday's meeting
9. My kindle from high school still works
10. Comfortable bed with no mandatory wake-up time

## How Did I Push the Needle Forward?

- Keeping up this daily reflection thing
