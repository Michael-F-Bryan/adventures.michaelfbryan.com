&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;constraints&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> to your drawing. Constraints are a really powerful tool,
allowing the drafter to declare how parts of their drawing are related, then
letting the CAD program figure out how parameters can be manipulated in such
a way that&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can think of a constraint as some sort of mathematical relationship between
two or more parameters.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
