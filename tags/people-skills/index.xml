&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m someone who&amp;rsquo;s productivity levels change wildly depending on my
motivation levels. When I work on something which I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about or
which interests me on an intellectual level (e.g. computational geometry or
systems programming), I&amp;rsquo;m routinely 5-10x more productive than my peers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, if I&amp;rsquo;m working on something which is less personally interesting
(e.g. tracking down GUI bugs or creating yet another CRUD app) I&amp;rsquo;ll tend to

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing software long enough to be burned by all three at some
point, but as someone working in a small business who represents the software
side of our product and is constantly rubbing shoulders with non-programmers,
I believe the ability to correctly communicate an idea or concept in a way
that others can understand (i.e. to name things) is by far the most
important.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
